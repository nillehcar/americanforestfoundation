    America’s family-owned forests, supply the bulk of the nation’s renewable wood products

        <h2>HEALTHY FORESTS NEED HEALTHY MARKETS</h2>
        <span class="small-border"></span>

        <p>Traditional forest product markets are at an all time low, meaning forest owners are making less money to reinvest back into their land. Forests provide myriad public benefits: clean air, clean water, wildlife habitat, places to recreate, and the wood products we all use every day. Without revenue to maintain healthy and productive forests, many of those public benefits we all enjoy may cease to exist. Renewable enery and green building markets are emerging. Forest products are put at an unfair disadvantage--meaning forest owners have less revenue to reinvest in responsible stewardship.</p>

        <h2>PROBLEMS WITH EXISTING GREEN MARKETS</h2>
        <span class="small-border"></span>

        <p>Green Building. Public policies are developing at the federal, state and local level, encouraging the use of green building rating systems. While this is certainly a step in the right direction for sustainability, existing policies put wood--an environmentally responsible material--at a real disadvantage.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, these policies could help keep family-owned forests with a commitment to utilize high environmental standards. However, if these policies are structured to discourage the use of wood products, particularly from ATFS-certified forests, family forest owners will be unable to access these growing markets, potentially foregoing added income important for helping families stay on the land and keep their land forested.</p>
