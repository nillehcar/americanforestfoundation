      <span class="small-border"></span>
        <p>In primary and secondary schools environmental education, especially with an outdoor learning component, has been shown to dramatically improve overall student performance, particularly in science and math, including test scores. Environmental education also helps build “environmental literacy” among the public who will then be more likely to take action to conserve and sustain forests and the environment.</p>
        <p>Through its program <a href="www.plt.org">Project Learning Tree</a>. The American Forest Foundation has provided one of the nations’ widely-used environmental education curriculum in America for over 35 years. More than 500,000 teachers have been trained to use Project Learning Tree curriculum, reaching more than 75 million students. PLT teaches students how to think, not what to think, about the complex environmental issues they will face in the coming decades.</p>
        <p>AFF is also a proud supporter of the No Child Left Inside Act, legislation introduced by Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Congressman John Sarbanes of Maryland to include environmental education as part of a new Elementary and Secondary Education Act.</p>
        <p>Whether your organization is large or small, nationally recognized, or a group of local activists, you can work in coalition with PLT to help propel environmental education. Collaborate on strategy, broaden our outreach, and share your ideas on how to make PLT an even stronger leader of environmental education.</p>
