        <li>Develop and advance policies and programs that support conservation, environmental education, and sustainable forests.</li>
        <li>Enhance the ecological, social, and economic viability of family forestland ownership.</li>
        <li>Increase the number of family forest owners who sustainably manage natural resources.</li>
