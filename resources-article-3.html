		One of the American Forest Foundation’s (AFF’s) signature programs is our work with the Driftless Forest Network, a partnership forged to conserve an iconic 2.1-million-acre Wisconsin landscape of oak and hickory forests.

    	<div class="text-wrapper-article center">

    	<p>The Driftless Area provides a wide variety of irreplaceable benefits to the region including clean water, birding and hunting opportunities, sustainable wood products, and jobs.
      Most of the Driftless Area’s forestland is privately owned. Working on the ground with our coalition partners, AFF is reaching out to “unengaged” landowners with the goal of improving forest stewardship and conservation outcomes. We’re doing similar landscape-scale work with woodland owners in Mississippi and New England.</p>

  		<p>The landowner outreach efforts in the Driftless recently garnered national recognition for AFF and its partners. On September 25, the National Association of State Foresters (NASF) presented the Jim Sledge Current Achievement Award for Forest Resource Management to Jerry Greenberg, AFF’s Senior Vice President, Conservation (pictured at right). He shared the award with Buddy Huffaker, Executive Director of the Aldo Leopold Foundation, and Carol Nielsen, Private Forestry Specialist with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR).</p>

  		<p>The award recognizes the innovation and leadership AFF and its partners are bringing to the challenge of engaging landowners who are not actively managing their land. Testing and new outreach tools and messages designed to help “meet landowners where they are,” while helping them meet their goals, has vastly increased the number of woodland owners engaged with and actively managing their land.</p>

  		<p>“It’s a great honor to be recognized by NASF, one of our key partners,” says Greenberg. “A number of state foresters have worked with us closely along the way. In Wisconsin, state forester Paul DeLong has been an essential partner, along with the entire Wisconsin DNR,” he notes. “The Wisconsin DNR is committed to trying new things and learning what works and then doing more based on what we have learned.”</p>

  		<p>Greenberg also credits the work of Maryland state forester Steve Koehn and Mississippi state forester Charlie Morgan. “Both have been great partners in our efforts to find new tools and strategies for reaching unengaged landowners and getting good stewardship and conservation outcomes on the ground,” he says.</p>

      <p>Greenberg accepted the NASF award “on behalf of AFF and all of our partners who are trying new ideas, evaluating results and learning how to do this work differently—whether they are in Wisconsin, or the northern forests of New England, or the longleaf Piney Woods of southeastern Mississippi.”</p>

      <p>As excited as Greenberg is by the work going on in the Driftless Area and other parts of the country, “we know there’s no single answer, no easy way to reach landowners and help them get engaged with their land,” he says. “We did not get this award from NASF because we’ve found The Answer. We are being recognized for a commitment to testing, evaluation and learning.”</p>
