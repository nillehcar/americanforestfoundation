        <h2>WHY DO WE CARE ABOUT THE FARM BILL?</h2>
        <span class="small-border"></span>

        <p>Most of America’s forests are owned privately, and nearly 282 million acres of forestland are owned by 22 million family forest owners.</p>

        <p>Of the 22 million forest owners, less than 4 percent have a management plan, meaning very few are actively managing their forests and have a plan for future stewardship. At the same time, these forests are under pressure from ever-increasing threats including wildfires, invasive species, and building developments.</p>

        <p>Leaving forests alone is simply not an option. The first step to engaging family forest owners in conservation is through solid outreach, education, and technical assistance—all of which can be attained with the help of USDA Farm Bill conservation programs.</p>
