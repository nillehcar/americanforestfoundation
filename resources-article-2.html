		Eight major forest products companies in North Carolina have joined with the North Carolina Forest Service and the American Tree Farm System® (ATFS, a program of the American Forest Foundation) in a major outreach effort to expand the amount of ATFS-certified forest acreage in the state.

    	<p>The partnership involves Domtar Corporation, Enviva, H.W. Culp Lumber Co., KapStone Paper and Packaging, Louisiana Pacific, Resolute Forest Products, RockTenn and Weyerhaeuser Company. All of the companies have contributed to a new outreach campaign that will engage private landowners in the state’s forest stewardship program, letting them know about the market opportunities available to certified forest owners and the many other benefits of ATFS certification. The North Carolina Forest Service has pledged in-kind support.</p>

		  <p>The effort is “a win for family forest owners, for our partners in the forest products sector, and for their customers who want more certified fiber,” says American Forest Foundation President and CEO Tom Martin. “The expansion of the certified family forest base supports local jobs in the green economy, and also serves as a source of sustainable local wood for building and other materials.”</p>
