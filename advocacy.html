      <h2>WHY MUST WE ADVOCATE?</h2>

      <div class="line"></div>

      <p>If America’s forest legacy is to continue, government policies must address the many challenges facing private forest owners who own most of America’s forests. The American Forest Foundation (AFF) works on-the-ground with families. teachers and elected officials to promote stewardship and protect our nation’s forest heritage. In Washington, AFF is the leading voice for 22 million family forest owners and 500,000 environmental educators.</p>

      <p>Family forest owners need tools to keep their forests healthy, but government policies can help or hinder their ability to do right by their land. By advocating for or against policies that impact forest stewardship, forest owners can help set the tone and policy agenda in Washington.</p>

      <h2>POLICY ISSUES</h2>

      <p>The American Forest Foundation works on-the-ground with elected officials to promote stewardship and protect our nation’s forest heritage. Clean air, clean water, habitat for wildlife, wood for sustainable building, good paying rural jobs, and nature for hiking, hunting and fishing--all come from America’s family forests.</p>

      <h2>CURRENT ISSUES</h2>

      <h4>1 - FOREST INVASIVE PESTS AND PATHOGENS</h4>

      <p>The damage to our communities, our environment, and our economy from invasive species is tremendous. Some estimate the damages at over $138 billion annually, due to losses in the forest products industry, the tourism and recreation industry, and woodland owner income.</p>

      <p>A recent study found that wood boring insects such as the Emerald Ash Borer and Asian Longhorned Beetle are having a significant economic impact resulting in approximately $1.7 billion in local government expenditures plus an additional $1.5 billion per year in losses to property owners as a result of removal costs and reduced residential property values.</p>

      <p>Approximately 9 percent of southern forests or about 19 million acres are currently occupied by one or more of the 330 invasive terrestrial plants in the South.</p>

      <p>Japanese honeysuckle already occupies more forest land in the region than any other invasive plant; it is projected to spread by an additional 65,000 acres per year.</p>

      <p>Cogongrass, listed as a noxious weed by federal and state authorities, is already present on 66,000 acres. As these statistics illustrate, the threat is not going away any time soon.</p>

      <p>While much harder to quantify, the impact of invasive species on our environment is probably more severe and includes impacts like denuded watersheds, destruction of critical habitat for wildlife, and complete obliteration of tree species. If a forest pest infests a family woodland owner’s land, it can mean complete destruction of their land, loss of a significant family treasure, and a severe reduction in land-based income, despite intense investment in time, effort, and money. Listed below are just a handful of the invasive pests America’s family forest owners face today.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Emerald Ash Borer: An invasive insect from Siberia, China, and Korea, it eats itsway through the trunk and major branches of trees, cutting off water and nutrient flow to the rest of the tree. The Emerald Ash Borer has killed tens of millions of ash trees in southern Michigan alone since its introduction in 2002. The insect has spread to more than ten other states, and studies estimate the cost of control and damage at $20 billion over the 10 years.</li>
        <li>Gypsy Moth: Originally introduced in the U.S. from Europe or Asia in the 1860s, the gyspy moth feeds on the leaves of hardwoods, particularly economically valuable oak stands. One million acres are affected throughout the eastern US annually.</li>
        <li>Asian Longhorned Beetle: Introduced from China in the 1980s, this beetle is currently present in New York, New Jersey, and recently expanded to Worcester, Massachusetts. Its larvae bore and feed on a range of hardwoods. If it becomes well established, the beetle could cause significant disruptions to the tourism and maple syrup industries in the northeastern U.S.</li>
        <li>Cogongrass: Introduced in Alabama in 1911, this invasive grass from the South Pacific and South Asia has overtaken more acreage in the Southeast than kudzu. Cogongrass spreads through seeding and through the use of tilling equipment and causes increases in the temperatures of forest fires—leading to severe, unnatural damage to forested ecosystems following wildfires.</li>
        <li>Sudden Oak Death: Threatens nearly 100 North American species, including common trees such as oaks, black walnut, sugar maple, and magnolia. This pathogen spreads through the transport of infested nursery plants. In 2009, 24 nurseries had infested plants in Florida, Mississippi, North and South Carolina, Texas, and California.</li>
        <li>Sirex Woodwasp: Infests pine species and currently occupies a great deal of New York, Pennsylvania, and parts of Vermont, Michigan, and Ohio. While other woodwasps only prey on dead pines, the sirex attacks living trees as well, laying eggs that, when hatched, eat their way through the trunk.</li>

      <h4>2 - FORESTS IN THE FARM BILL</h4>

      <p>The first step to engaging family forest owners in good forest management and long-term stewardship objectives is a solid outreach, education, and technical assistance strategy which can be acheived through participation in USDA Farm Bill conservation programs.</p>

      <h5>WHY DO WE CARE ABOUT THE FARM BILL?</h5>

      <p>Most of America’s forests are owned privately, and nearly 282 million acres of forestland are owned by 22 million family forest owners.</p>

      <p>Of the 22 million forest owners, less than 4 percent have a management plan, meaning very few are actively managing their forests and have a plan for future stewardship. At the same time, these forests are under pressure from ever-increasing threats:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>325 million private acres are at risk of wildfire</li>
        <li>58 million acres are at risk of being overtaken by invasive species</li>
        <li>Development threatens to convert 57 million acres by 2030</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Leaving forests alone is simply not an option. The first step to engaging family forest owners in conservation is through solid outreach, education, and technical assistance—all of which can be attained with the help of USDA Farm Bill conservation programs.</p>

      <h4>3 - MARKETS FOR WOOD PRODUCTS</h4>

      <p>America’s family-owned forests, supply the bulk of the nation’s renewable wood products, but in emerging renewable enery and green building markets, forest products are put at an unfair disadvantage--meaning forest owners have less revenue to reinvest in responsible stewardship.</p>

      <h5>HEALTHY FORESTS NEED HEALTHY MARKETS</h5>

      <p>Traditional forest product markets are at an all time low, meaning forest owners are making less money to reinvest back into their land. Forests provide myriad public benefits: clean air, clean water, wildlife habitat, places to recreate, and the wood products we all use every day. Without revenue to maintain healthy and productive forests, many of those public benefits we all enjoy may cease to exist.</p>

      <h5>PROBLEMS WITH EXISTING GREEN MARKETS</h5>

      <p>Green Building. Public policies are developing at the federal, state and local level, encouraging the use of green building rating systems. While this is certainly a step in the right direction for sustainability, existing policies put wood--an environmentally responsible material--at a real disadvantage.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, these policies could help keep family-owned forests with a commitment to utilize high environmental standards. However, if these policies are structured to discourage the use of wood products, particularly from ATFS-certified forests, family forest owners will be unable to access these growing markets, potentially foregoing added income important for helping families stay on the land and keep their land forested.</p>
