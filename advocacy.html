      <h2>WHY MUST WE ADVOCATE?</h2>
      <span class="small-border"></span>

      <p>If America’s forest legacy is to continue, government policies must address the many challenges facing private forest owners who own most of America’s forests. The American Forest Foundation (AFF) works on-the-ground with families. teachers and elected officials to promote stewardship and protect our nation’s forest heritage. In Washington, AFF is the leading voice for 22 million family forest owners and 500,000 environmental educators.</p>

      <p>Family forest owners need tools to keep their forests healthy, but government policies can help or hinder their ability to do right by their land. By advocating for or against policies that impact forest stewardship, forest owners can help set the tone and policy agenda in Washington.</p>
