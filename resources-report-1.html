		Today, building green is good business. As a building material, wood offers many environmental benefits that matter to communities across the country.

	      <p>It is the only major building material that is renewable and sustainable. Compared with concrete and steel, wood products help to increase a building’s energy efficiency and minimize the energy consumed throughout the life of the product. Using wood also helps keep carbon out of the atmosphere, helping to mitigate climate change. Trees store carbon dioxide as they grow. After harvest, wood products continue to store much of this carbon. These benefits continue when wood is reclaimed to manufacture other products. Wood. It’s a better way to build.</p>

				<li>Wood is better for the environment in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, air and water pollution, and other impacts. - Steel and concrete consume 12% and 20% more energy, emit 15% and 29% more greenhouse gases and release 10% and 12% more pollutants into the air, and generate 300% and 225% more water pollutants than wood.</li>

				<li>Wood helps reduce energy consumption across the life cycle of growth, harvest, transport, manufacture and construction compared to other structural building products according to life cycle assessment (LCA).</li>

				<li>Wood can improve energy efficiency. An excellent insulator, wood has a cellular structure that allows for air pockets, helping to slow the conductivity of heat.</li>

				<li>Wood products store carbon, helping to mitigate climate change while also providing a good alternative for materials that require large amounts of fossil fuels to produce.</li>

				<li>Using wood helps to sustain our forests and increases our carbon storage potential by helping to ensure that it is affordable for forest owners to continue sustainably managing their forestland.</li>

	<h2>WHY MUST WE ADVOCATE?</h2>
    <span class="small-border"></span>

    <p>America’s forests provide us with multiple benefits – clean air and water, wildlife habitat, places to hike, fish and hunt, wood products we use every day, and good paying jobs in rural communities. And it’s families, not the federal government and not private industry, that are the largest forest ownership group in America.</p>	

    </div> <!-- END WRAPPER with CENTER -->

    <div class="text-wrapper-article">

			<ul>
				<li>Family forest owners own 35 percent of U.S. forestland—more than the federal government or private industry, and the majority own small parcels of land. Strong wood markets help to ensure these families have income from their land, making it affordable for families to sustain their forestland.</li>

				<li>Family woodland owners in the American Tree Farm System®, the largest and oldest sustainable woodland system in America, internationally recognized and meeting strict third-party certification standards, sustainably manage more than 26 million acres of forestland in America.</li>

				<li>Private landowners in the U.S. plant about four million trees every day—five trees each year for every man, woman and child in America.</li>

				<li>For the past 100 years, the total forest area in the U.S. has been stable and even grew by two million acres from 2000 to 2005 , a time when markets were strong.</li>

				<li>The U.S. Forest Service projects a loss of 16-34 million acres of forestland in the U.S. by 2060. The South is expected to have the greatest loss of forest (nine-21 million acres).</li>

				<li>When we had stronger markets, America had more land in forested conditions, according to historical data from the USFS.</li>
