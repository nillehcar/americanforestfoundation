		When you hear a barred owl calling “who cooks for you?” in your woods, chances are it’s calling from a nest cavity in the limb of a dying tree.

    	<p>When you see the bright red head of a woodpecker as it streaks through the forest, chances are it’s flying from the home it excavated in a hollow snag. When you encounter
		a fox, field mouse, opossum, raccoon or other woodland mammal, chances are that dead logs, stumps and brush on your forest floor provide the cover these creatures need to survive. And when you turn over a fallen log to find a salamander, you uncover the hidden world that thrives beneath the moist, decaying wood.</p>

		<p>Chances are, the dead wood that might seem useless to you is really “home, sweet home” to one or more forest creatures. In fact, wildlife biologists estimate that as many as 20 percent of woodland species depend on dead or dying wood to survive and thrive. Since managing for wildlife is one of the cornerstones of good forest management, it’s good to keep snags, brush, slash and other dead wood in your woodlands. By doing so, you can help provide homes for creatures of all kinds.</p>

		<p>“As most of America’s forests are privately owned, landowners play a key role in our wildlife’s future,” says Mike Burns, forester and program resource manager with the American Forest Foundation.</p>

		<p>Two declining species of woodpeckers illustrate the importance of dead wood. Lewis’s woodpecker in the West and the red-headed woodpecker in the East often nest in cut or burned forests where scattered trees, sparse underbrush and plentiful snags provide ideal habitat for gathering and storing nuts, catching insects and nesting. Because these declining species generally do not live in suburban or urban areas, privately owned woodlands are crucial to their continued survival. The cavities they excavate are later occupied by other forest creatures such as flying squirrels, bluebirds, snakes or lizards.</p>

		<p>Snags, logs and brushpiles a vital to a wide variety of wild creatures, and detailed new information posted on the MyLandPlan.org website, will tell you all you need to know about the value of dead wood.</p>
