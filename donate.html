  <h2>YOUR CONTRIBUTION</h2>
  <span class="small-border"></span>
  <p>A commitment to the next generation unites our nationwide network of forest owners and educators working to keep our forests healthy and our children well-prepared for the future they will inherit. We use forests as a window on the world to help keep children connected to the natural world and aware of the importance of stewardship. When you give to the American Forest Foundation, you are ensuring a healthy future for our nationâ€™s forests and educating the next generation of Americans about the environmental challenges they will face. 100% of your contribution goes towards our programs. Nothing goes to administration or overhead.</p>
