<!--ABOUT-->

<h1>ABOUT</h1>
<h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>

<p>The American Forest Foundation (AFF) works on-the-ground with families, teachers and elected officials to promote stewardship and protect the values provided by our
nation’s forest heritage. A commitment to the next generation unites our nationwide network of forest owners and teachers. These devoted professionals work to keep our
forests healthy and our children well-prepared for the future they will inherit.</p>
<p>AFF works nationwide and in partnership with local, state and national groups to address ecological and economic challenges that require the engagement of family forest owners.</p>

<h2>VISION</h2>

<p>AFF is committed to creating a future where North American forests are sustained by the public that understand and values the social, economic, and environmental benefits they
provide to our communities, our nation, and the world.</p>

<h3>MISSION</h3>
<p>We ensure the sustainability of America’s family forests for present and future generations in conjunction with our strategic partners.</p>

<h2>VALUES</h2>
<ul>
	<li>All American have a stake in the future of our nation’s forests.</li>
	<li>Forest owners are stewards of vital resources that provide value to their communities, the nation, and the world.</li>
	<li>Environmental education enables citizens to learn the skills and gain the knowledge necessary to make informed decisions about our natural resources.</li>
	<li>Our success depends on the passion of volunteers and the capacity of state based organizations who share our goals. Likewise, we share responsibility for assuring they have the resources they need to succeed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>LONG-TERM GOALS</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Increase public awareness and understanding of the role that forests and the environment play in our lives, and build the skills and commitment needed to conserve and sustain them.</li>
	<li>Develop and advance policies and programs that support conservation, environmental education, and sustainable forests.</li>
	<li>Enhance the ecological, social, and economic viability of family forestland ownership.</li>
	<li>Increase the number of family forest owners who sustainably manage natural resources.</li>
	<li>Support research that fills gaps in our understanding of forest ecology, the socio-economic dimensions of forest ownership and management, and the impact of public policies on forest sustainability.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can’t do any of this without the support and commitment of our partners, volunteers, and supporters.</p>

<h3>ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION</h3>

<p>Tomorrow’s leaders need to be equipped for tomorrow’s challenges, and we must adequately prepare our children for the future they will inherit.</p>

<h2>PROJECT LEARNING TREE</h2>

<p>In primary and secondary schools environmental education, especially with an outdoor learning component, has been shown to dramatically improve overall student performance, particularly in science and math,
including test scores. Environmental education also helps build “environmental literacy” among the public who will then be more likely to take action to conserve and sustain forests and the environment.</p>

<p>Through its program Project Learning Tree® (link: www.plt.org), The American Forest Foundation has provided one of the nations’ widely-used environmental education curriculum in America for over 35 years.
More than 500,000 teachers have been trained to use Project Learning Tree curriculum, reaching more than 75 million students. PLT teaches students how to think, not what to think, about the complex environmental
issues they will face in the coming decades.</p>

<p>AFF is also a proud supporter of the No Child Left Inside Act, legislation introduced by Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Congressman John Sarbanes of Maryland to include environmental education as part
of a new Elementary and Secondary Education Act.</p>

<p>Whether your organization is large or small, nationally recognized, or a group of local activists, you can work in coalition with PLT to help propel environmental education. Collaborate on strategy, broaden
our outreach, and share your ideas on how to make PLT an even stronger leader of environmental education.</p>

<h2>THE AMERICAN TREE FARM SYSTEM</h2>

<p>The American Tree Farm System® (link: www.treefarmsystem.org) is a network of 82,000 certified Tree Farmers sustainably managing 24 million acres of certified forestland. ATFS is the largest and oldest
sustainable family woodland system in America, internationally recognized, meeting strict third-party certification standards. ATFS is a program of the American Forest Foundation.</p>

<p>For more than 70 years, ATFS has enhanced the quality of America’s woodlands by giving private forest owners the tools they need to keep their forests healthy and productive.</p>

<p>These landowners play an important role in helping stem the loss of America’s woodlands. You can identify their land by the widely-recognizable green and white diamond-shaped Tree Farm signs.</p>

<p>Water. Wildlife. Recreation. Wood. The four sides of the Tree Farm sign tell the story of sustainable forestry — a thriving forestland that has clean water, a healthy wildlife habitat and recreational
opportunities.</p>

<h2>HOW TO BECOME A CERTIFIED TREE FARM</h2>

<p>ATFS has established standards and guidelines for property owners to meet to become a Certified Tree Farm.</p>

<p>To become certified, ATFS landowners must:</p>
<ul>
	<li>own at least 10 acres of forestland</li>
	<li>implement a written forest management plan</li>
	<li>follow the American Forest Foundation’s Standards of Sustainability for Forest Certification for Private Forestlands (link: https://www.forestfoundation.org/stuff/contentmgr/files/1/c10f2aae2c1d314e6b69e55a0a134b73/misc/aff_2010_2015_standards_website.pdf)</li>
</ul>

<p>Tree Farms are inspected and certified to assure proper forest management that includes the conservation of soil, water, and wildlife.</p>

<h2>ARTICLES</h2>

<h4>1 - WHAT GOOD IS DEAD WOOD?</h4>
<p>When you hear a barred owl calling “who cooks for you?” in your woods, chances are it’s calling from a nest cavity in the limb of a dying tree. When you see the bright red head of a woodpecker
as it streaks through the forest, chances are it’s flying from the home it excavated in a hollow snag. When you encounter a fox, field mouse, opossum, raccoon or other woodland mammal, chances are that
dead logs, stumps and brush on your forest floor provide the cover these creatures need to survive. And when you turn over a fallen log to find a salamander, you uncover the hidden world that thrives beneath the moist, decaying wood.</p>

<p>Chances are, the dead wood that might seem useless to you is really “home, sweet home” to one or more forest creatures. In fact, wildlife biologists estimate that as many as 20 percent of woodland species depend
on dead or dying wood to survive and thrive. Since managing for wildlife is one of the cornerstones of good forest management, it’s good to keep snags, brush, slash and other dead wood in your woodlands.
By doing so, you can help provide homes for creatures of all kinds.</p>

<p>“As most of America’s forests are privately owned, landowners play a key role in our wildlife’s future,” says Mike Burns, forester and program resource manager with the American Forest Foundation.</p>

<p>Two declining species of woodpeckers illustrate the importance of dead wood. Lewis’s woodpecker in the West and the red-headed woodpecker in the East often nest in cut or burned forests where scattered trees,
sparse underbrush and plentiful snags provide ideal habitat for gathering and storing nuts, catching insects and nesting. Because these declining species generally do not live in suburban or urban areas,
privately owned woodlands are crucial to their continued survival. The cavities they excavate are later occupied by other forest creatures such as flying squirrels, bluebirds, snakes or lizards.</p>

<p>Snags, logs and brushpiles a vital to a wide variety of wild creatures, and detailed new information posted on the MyLandPlan.org website, will tell you all you need to know about the value of dead wood.</p>


<h4>2 - EXPANDING FOREST STEWARDSHIP IN NORTH CAROLINA</h4>

<p>Eight major forest products companies in North Carolina have joined with the North Carolina Forest Service and the American Tree Farm System® (ATFS, a program of the American Forest Foundation) in a major outreach effort to expand the amount of ATFS-certified forest acreage in the state.</p>

<p>The partnership involves Domtar Corporation, Enviva, H.W. Culp Lumber Co., KapStone Paper and Packaging, Louisiana Pacific, Resolute Forest Products, RockTenn and Weyerhaeuser Company. All of the companies have contributed to a new outreach campaign that will engage private landowners in the
state’s forest stewardship program, letting them know about the market opportunities available to certified forest owners and the many other benefits of ATFS certification. The North Carolina Forest Service has pledged in-kind support.</p>

<p>The effort is “a win for family forest owners, for our partners in the forest products sector, and for their customers who want more certified fiber,” says American Forest Foundation President and CEO Tom Martin. “The expansion of the certified family forest base supports local jobs in the green economy, and also serves as a source of sustainable local wood for building and other materials.”</p>

<h4>3 - AFF HONORED FOR LANDOWNER OUTREACH EFFORTS</h4>

<p>One of the American Forest Foundation’s (AFF’s) signature programs is our work with the Driftless Forest Network, a partnership forged to conserve an iconic 2.1-million-acre Wisconsin landscape of oak and hickory forests. The Driftless Area provides a wide variety of irreplaceable benefits to the region including clean water, birding and hunting opportunities, sustainable wood products, and jobs.</p>

<p>Most of the Driftless Area’s forestland is privately owned. Working on the ground with our coalition partners, AFF is reaching out to “unengaged” landowners with the goal of improving forest stewardship and conservation outcomes. We’re doing similar landscape-scale work with woodland owners in Mississippi and New England.</p>

<p>The landowner outreach efforts in the Driftless recently garnered national recognition for AFF and its partners. On September 25, the National Association of State Foresters (NASF) presented the Jim Sledge Current Achievement Award for Forest Resource Management to Jerry Greenberg, AFF’s Senior Vice President, Conservation (pictured at right). He shared the award with Buddy Huffaker, Executive Director of the Aldo Leopold Foundation, and Carol Nielsen, Private Forestry Specialist with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR).</p>

<p>The award recognizes the innovation and leadership AFF and its partners are bringing to the challenge of engaging landowners who are not actively managing their land. Testing and new outreach tools and messages designed to help “meet landowners where they are,” while helping them meet their goals, has vastly increased the number of woodland owners engaged with and actively managing their land.</p>

<p>“It’s a great honor to be recognized by NASF, one of our key partners,” says Greenberg. “A number of state foresters have worked with us closely along the way. In Wisconsin, state forester Paul DeLong has been an essential partner, along with the entire Wisconsin DNR,” he notes. “The Wisconsin DNR is committed to trying new things and learning what works and then doing more based on what we have learned.”</p>

<p>Greenberg also credits the work of Maryland state forester Steve Koehn and Mississippi state forester Charlie Morgan. “Both have been great partners in our efforts to find new tools and strategies for reaching unengaged landowners and getting good stewardship and conservation outcomes on the ground,” he says.</p>

<p>Greenberg accepted the NASF award “on behalf of AFF and all of our partners who are trying new ideas, evaluating results and learning how to do this work differently—whether they are in Wisconsin, or the northern forests of New England, or the longleaf Piney Woods of southeastern Mississippi.”</p>

<p>As excited as Greenberg is by the work going on in the Driftless Area and other parts of the country, “we know there’s no single answer, no easy way to reach landowners and help them get engaged with their land,” he says. “We did not get this award from NASF because we’ve found The Answer. We are being recognized for a commitment to testing, evaluation and learning.”</p>

<h4>1 - BUILDING WITH WOOD</h4>

<p>Today, building green is good business. As a building material, wood offers many environmental benefits that matter to communities across the country. It is the only major building material that is renewable and sustainable. Compared with concrete and steel, wood products help to increase a building’s energy efficiency and minimize the energy consumed throughout the life of the product. Using wood also helps keep carbon out of the atmosphere, helping to mitigate climate change. Trees store carbon dioxide as they grow. After harvest, wood products continue to store much of this carbon. These benefits continue when wood is reclaimed to manufacture other products. Wood. It’s a better way to build.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Wood is better for the environment in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, air and water pollution, and other impacts. - Steel and concrete consume 12% and 20% more energy, emit 15% and 29% more greenhouse gases and release 10% and 12% more pollutants into the air, and generate 300% and 225% more water pollutants than wood.</li>
	<li>Wood helps reduce energy consumption across the life cycle of growth, harvest, transport, manufacture and construction compared to other structural building products according to life cycle assessment (LCA).</li>
	<li>Wood can improve energy efficiency. An excellent insulator, wood has a cellular structure that allows for air pockets, helping to slow the conductivity of heat.</li>
	<li>Wood products store carbon, helping to mitigate climate change while also providing a good alternative for materials that require large amounts of fossil fuels to produce.</li>
	<li>Using wood helps to sustain our forests and increases our carbon storage potential by helping to ensure that it is affordable for forest owners to continue sustainably managing their forestland</li>
</ul>

<h2>BUILDING WITH WOOD HELPS KEEP FORESTS AS FOREST</h2>

<p>America’s forests provide us with multiple benefits – clean air and water, wildlife habitat, places to hike, fish and hunt, wood products we use every day, and good paying jobs in rural communities. And it’s families, not the federal government and not private industry, that are the largest forest ownership group in America.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Family forest owners own 35 percent of U.S. forestland—more than the federal government or private industry, and the majority own small parcels of land. Strong wood markets help to ensure these families have income from their land, making it affordable for families to sustain their forestland.</li>
	<li>Family woodland owners in the American Tree Farm System®, the largest and oldest sustainable woodland system in America, internationally recognized and meeting strict third-party certification standards, sustainably manage more than 26 million acres of forestland in America.</li>
	<li>Private landowners in the U.S. plant about four million trees every day—five trees each year for every man, woman and child in America.</li>
	<li>For the past 100 years, the total forest area in the U.S. has been stable and even grew by two million acres from 2000 to 2005 , a time when markets were strong.</li>
	<li>The U.S. Forest Service projects a loss of 16-34 million acres of forestland in the U.S. by 2060. The South is expected to have the greatest loss of forest (nine-21 million acres).</li>
	<li>When we had stronger markets, America had more land in forested conditions, according to historical data from the USFS.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2 - FARM BILL UPDATE</h4>

<p>Farm Bill Conservation programs have been instrumental in increasing the availability of conservation tools for forest owners and have resulted in real stewardship improvements on the ground.</p>
<p>The most common USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) conservation programs for forest practices are the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), the Conservation Stewardship</p>
<p>Program (CSP) and the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP).</p>
<p>Programs in the Farm Bill offer essential support to bolster and improve the stewardship of family woodlands. To protect forest-derived public benefits and strengthen rural communities, family forest owners need these tools and technical assistance to better manage their woodlands for present and future generations.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our nation’s forests face more threats than ever before. Development, wildfire, and invasive species threaten the health and vitality of our forest ecosystems, requiring landowners do even more to ensure the long-term sustainability of their forests.</p>
<p>This report, the fourth in a series, investigates the extent to which forest owners are using available conservation program resources and accomplishing real conservation on the ground. The results indicate funding for forest practices is continually increasing, but still makes up only a very small portion of total conservation program spending.</p>

<h5>KEY FINDINGS:</h5>
<ul>
	<li>EQIP funding for forest practices increased 32% in one year.</li>
	<li>Almost 60 million WHIP dollars have contributed to improvements in forest wildlife habitat over the past 5 years.</li>
	<li>In four years, over 5 million forest acres were enrolled in CSP, elevating the level of stewardship on these lands tremendously.</li>
	<li>Most importantly, all these programs leverage landowner and private funds, sometimes dollar-for-dollar, multiplying the impact of finacial assistance investments.</li>

<!--ADVOCACY-->


<h1>ADVOCACY</h1>
<h3>WHY MUST WE ADVOCATE?</h3>
<p>If America’s forest legacy is to continue, government policies must address the many challenges facing private forest owners who own most of America’s forests.</p>
<p>The American Forest Foundation (AFF) works on-the-ground with families. teachers and elected officials to promote stewardship and protect our nation’s forest heritage. In Washington, AFF is the leading voice for 22 million family forest owners and 500,000 environmental educators.</p>
<p>Family forest owners need tools to keep their forests healthy, but government policies can help or hinder their ability to do right by their land. By advocating for or against policies that impact forest stewardship, forest owners can help set the tone and policy agenda in Washington.</p>

<h3>POLICY ISSUES</h3>
<p>The American Forest Foundation works on-the-ground with elected officials to promote stewardship and protect our nation’s forest heritage. Clean air, clean water, habitat for wildlife, wood for sustainable building, good paying rural jobs, and nature for hiking, hunting and fishing--all come from America’s family forests.</p>

<h2>CURRENT ISSUES</h2>

<h4>1 - FOREST INVASIVE PESTS AND PATHOGENS</h4>

The damage to our communities, our environment, and our economy from invasive species is tremendous. Some estimate the damages at over $138 billion annually, due to losses in the forest products industry, the tourism and recreation industry, and woodland owner income.
A recent study found that wood boring insects such as the Emerald Ash Borer and Asian Longhorned Beetle are having a significant economic impact resulting in approximately $1.7 billion in local government expenditures plus an additional $1.5 billion per year in losses to property owners as a result of removal costs and reduced residential property values.
Approximately 9 percent of southern forests or about 19 million acres are currently occupied by one or more of the 330 invasive terrestrial plants in the South.
Japanese honeysuckle already occupies more forest land in the region than any other invasive plant; it is projected to spread by an additional 65,000 acres per year.
Cogongrass, listed as a noxious weed by federal and state authorities, is already present on 66,000 acres. As these statistics illustrate, the threat is not going away any time soon.
While much harder to quantify, the impact of invasive species on our environment is probably more severe and includes impacts like denuded watersheds, destruction of critical habitat for wildlife, and complete obliteration of tree species. If a forest pest infests a family woodland owner’s land, it can mean complete destruction of their land, loss of a significant family treasure, and a severe reduction in land-based income, despite intense investment in time, effort, and money. Listed below are just a handful of the invasive pests America’s family forest owners face today.
- Emerald Ash Borer: An invasive insect from Siberia, China, and Korea, it eats itsway through the trunk and major branches of trees, cutting off water and nutrient flow to the rest of the tree. The Emerald Ash Borer has killed tens of millions of ash trees in southern Michigan alone since its introduction in 2002. The insect has spread to more than ten other states, and studies estimate the cost of control and damage at $20 billion over the 10 years.
Gypsy Moth: Originally introduced in the U.S. from Europe or Asia in the 1860s, the gyspy moth feeds on the leaves of hardwoods, particularly economically valuable oak stands. One million acres are affected throughout the eastern US annually.
- Asian Longhorned Beetle: Introduced from China in the 1980s, this beetle is currently present in New York, New Jersey, and recently expanded to Worcester, Massachusetts. Its larvae bore and feed on a range of hardwoods. If it becomes well established, the beetle could cause significant disruptions to the tourism and maple syrup industries in the northeastern U.S.
- Cogongrass: Introduced in Alabama in 1911, this invasive grass from the South Pacific and South Asia has overtaken more acreage in the Southeast than kudzu. Cogongrass spreads through seeding and through the use of tilling equipment and causes increases in the temperatures of forest fires—leading to severe, unnatural damage to forested ecosystems following wildfires.
- Sudden Oak Death: Threatens nearly 100 North American species, including common trees such as oaks, black walnut, sugar maple, and magnolia. This pathogen spreads through the transport of infested nursery plants. In 2009, 24 nurseries had infested plants in Florida, Mississippi, North and South Carolina, Texas, and California.
- Sirex Woodwasp: Infests pine species and currently occupies a great deal of New York, Pennsylvania, and parts of Vermont, Michigan, and Ohio. While other woodwasps only prey on dead pines, the sirex attacks living trees as well, laying eggs that, when hatched, eat their way through the trunk.
2 - FORESTS IN THE FARM BILL
The first step to engaging family forest owners in good forest management and long-term stewardship objectives is a solid outreach, education, and technical assistance strategy which can be acheived through participation in USDA Farm Bill conservation programs.
WHY DO WE CARE ABOUT THE FARM BILL?
Most of America’s forests are owned privately, and nearly 282 million acres of forestland are owned by 22 million family forest owners.
Of the 22 million forest owners, less than 4 percent have a management plan, meaning very few are actively managing their forests and have a plan for future stewardship. At the same time, these forests are under pressure from ever-increasing threats:
- 325 million private acres are at risk of wildfire
- 58 million acres are at risk of being overtaken by invasive species
- Development threatens to convert 57 million acres by 2030
Leaving forests alone is simply not an option. The first step to engaging family forest owners in conservation is through solid outreach, education, and technical assistance—all of which can be attained with the help of USDA Farm Bill conservation programs.
3 - MARKETS FOR WOOD PRODUCTS
America’s family-owned forests, supply the bulk of the nation’s renewable wood products, but in emerging renewable enery and green building markets, forest products are put at an unfair disadvantage--meaning forest owners have less revenue to reinvest in responsible stewardship.
HEALTHY FORESTS NEED HEALTHY MARKETS
Traditional forest product markets are at an all time low, meaning forest owners are making less money to reinvest back into their land. Forests provide myriad public benefits: clean air, clean water, wildlife habitat, places to recreate, and the wood products we all use every day. Without revenue to maintain healthy and productive forests, many of those public benefits we all enjoy may cease to exist.
PROBLEMS WITH EXISTING GREEN MARKETS
Green Building. Public policies are developing at the federal, state and local level, encouraging the use of green building rating systems. While this is certainly a step in the right direction for sustainability, existing policies put wood--an environmentally responsible material--at a real disadvantage.
On the other hand, these policies could help keep family-owned forests with a commitment to utilize high environmental standards. However, if these policies are structured to discourage the use of wood products, particularly from ATFS-certified forests, family forest owners will be unable to access these growing markets, potentially foregoing added income important for helping families stay on the land and keep their land forested.
