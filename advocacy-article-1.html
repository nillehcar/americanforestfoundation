		Approximately 9 percent of southern forests or about 19 million acres are currently occupied by one or more of the 330 invasive terrestrial plants in the South.

	      <p>The damage to our communities, our environment, and our economy from invasive species is tremendous. Some estimate the damages at over $138 billion annually, due to losses in the forest products industry, the tourism and recreation industry, and woodland owner income.</p>

			<p>A recent study found that wood boring insects such as the Emerald Ash Borer and Asian Longhorned Beetle are having a significant economic impact resulting in approximately $1.7 billion in local government expenditures plus an additional $1.5 billion per year in losses to property owners as a result of removal costs and reduced residential property values.</p>

			<p>Approximately 9 percent of southern forests or about 19 million acres are currently occupied by one or more of the 330 invasive terrestrial plants in the South.</p>

			<p>Japanese honeysuckle already occupies more forest land in the region than any other invasive plant; it is projected to spread by an additional 65,000 acres per year.</p>

			<p>Cogongrass, listed as a noxious weed by federal and state authorities, is already present on 66,000 acres. As these statistics illustrate, the threat is not going away any time soon.</p>

			<p>While much harder to quantify, the impact of invasive species on our environment is probably more severe and includes impacts like denuded watersheds, destruction of critical habitat for wildlife, and complete obliteration of tree species. If a forest pest infests a family woodland owner’s land, it can mean complete destruction of their land, loss of a significant family treasure, and a severe reduction in land-based income, despite intense investment in time, effort, and money. Listed below are just a handful of the invasive pests America’s family forest owners face today.</p>

					<li>Emerald Ash Borer: An invasive insect from Siberia, China, and Korea, it eats itsway through the trunk and major branches of trees, cutting off water and nutrient flow to the rest of the tree. The Emerald Ash Borer has killed tens of millions of ash trees in southern Michigan alone since its introduction in 2002. The insect has spread to more than ten other states, and studies estimate the cost of control and damage at $20 billion over the 10 years.</li>
				
					<li>Gypsy Moth: Originally introduced in the U.S. from Europe or Asia in the 1860s, the gyspy moth feeds on the leaves of hardwoods, particularly economically valuable oak stands. One million acres are affected throughout the eastern US annually.</li>
				</div>


				<div class="unit-report unit-s-1 unit-m-1-2 unit-l-1-3 gutter">
					<li>Asian Longhorned Beetle: Introduced from China in the 1980s, this beetle is currently present in New York, New Jersey, and recently expanded to Worcester, Massachusetts. Its larvae bore and feed on a range of hardwoods. If it becomes well established, the beetle could cause significant disruptions to the tourism and maple syrup industries in the northeastern U.S.</li>

					<li>Cogongrass: Introduced in Alabama in 1911, this invasive grass from the South Pacific and South Asia has overtaken more acreage in the Southeast than kudzu. Cogongrass spreads through seeding and through the use of tilling equipment and causes increases in the temperatures of forest fires—leading to severe, unnatural damage to forested ecosystems following wildfires.</li>
				</div>


				<div class="unit-report unit-s-1 unit-m-1 unit-l-1-3 gutter">
					<li>Sudden Oak Death: Threatens nearly 100 North American species, including common trees such as oaks, black walnut, sugar maple, and magnolia. This pathogen spreads through the transport of infested nursery plants. In 2009, 24 nurseries had infested plants in Florida, Mississippi, North and South Carolina, Texas, and California.</li>

					<li>Sirex Woodwasp: Infests pine species and currently occupies a great deal of New York, Pennsylvania, and parts of Vermont, Michigan, and Ohio. While other woodwasps only prey on dead pines, the sirex attacks living trees as well, laying eggs that, when hatched, eat their way through the trunk.</li>
