		Farm Bill Conservation programs have been instrumental in increasing the availability of conservation tools for forest owners and have resulted in real stewardship improvements on the ground.

    	<div class="text-wrapper-article center">

	      <p>The most common USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) conservation programs for forest practices are the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) and the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP).</p>

        <p>Programs in the Farm Bill offer essential support to bolster and improve the stewardship of family woodlands. To protect forest-derived public benefits and strengthen rural communities, family forest owners need these tools and technical assistance to better manage their woodlands for present and future generations.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, our nation’s forests face more threats than ever before. Development, wildfire, and invasive species threaten the health and vitality of our forest ecosystems, requiring landowners do even more to ensure the long-term sustainability of their forests.</p>

        <p>This report, the fourth in a series, investigates the extent to which forest owners are using available conservation program resources and accomplishing real conservation on the ground. The results indicate funding for forest practices is continually increasing, but still makes up only a very small portion of total conservation program spending.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>EQIP funding for forest practices increased 32% in one year.</li>

				<li>Almost 60 million WHIP dollars have contributed to improvements in forest wildlife habitat over the past 5 years.</li>

				<li>In four years, over 5 million forest acres were enrolled in CSP, elevating the level of stewardship on these lands tremendously.</li>

				<li>Most importantly, all these programs leverage landowner and private funds, sometimes dollar-for-dollar, multiplying the impact of finacial assistance investments.</li>
